# Voting_vs_Tax

The 2020 US presidential election was a strange one.  
I wanted to analyse one bizarre phenomena, where conservative voters,  
who typically vote against taxation,  
in fact pay significantly less tax than more liberal voters.

I got the US election data from here:  
https://github.com/favstats/USElection2020-NYT-Results  

I got the tax data from the IRS  
https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-county-data  


We compute the Biden/Trump tax paid by each county  
to be the total tax paid by the county  
multiplied by the percentage of votes which went to Biden/Trump.  

The result is   

Trump_tax: $ 678.1870617226891 billion  
Biden_tax: $ 934.0734622773111 billion  

This corresponds to a tax per voter of:    

trump_tax_per_voter: $ 9372  
biden_tax_per_voter: $ 12069
